## Setup

Using the built-in[^bloat] python module
[`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), create a virtual
environment and activate it, e.g:
```
$ python -m venv ./venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Install requirements with
```
$ pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```

[^bloat]: As opposed to `virtualenv` or `conda`. Why does this course insist on
bloating my computer with unnecessary installations?
