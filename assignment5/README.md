I recommend setting up a virtual environment, e.g:
```{bash}
$ python -m venv ./venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:
```{bash}
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For exercise 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4, the required text files can be generated by
running `requesting_urls.py`, `filter_urls.py` and `time_planner.py`
(respectively) without any arguments.

Exercise 5.5 is not quite finished yet, but only plotting remains really. You
can test it by running `fetch_player_statistics.py`. It'll just print the
stats for now.
