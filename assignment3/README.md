# assignment3

Assignment is mostly implemented. But it's really naive; in the sense that all
the arrays are just flat. So the data structure isn't quite right. The
`__getitem__` is not implemented for more multi-dimensional arrays, but the
other operations should work, even n-dimensions.

Alas, this is all I got time for.
